# gdm-tools

This is a set of tools for Gnome's Display/Login Manager (GDM).

Currently, it includes only 'set-gdm-theme' tool and 'gnomeconf2gdm'.

### Caution!!!

**gdm-tools** is not being actively maintained anymore. There may be *small* bug fixes and other
changes here and there but don't expect any new features or even bug fixes if they require too much
fiddling around in the code.

[**GDM Settings**](https://gdm-settings.github.io) app is a GUI alternative to gdm-tools. It is
being actively maintained and has much more settings and customization options.

## FAQ:

1. Why can't I apply/set GDM themes downloaded from gnome-look.org or other pling.com like websites?

   **Ans:** Themes available in `GDM Themes` section of those websites are for old versions of GDM and current versions of GDM don't use that kind of themes. Newer versions of GDM use a compiled gnome-shell theme as their theme. Download and install (system-wide) themes available in `Gnome Shell Themes` section of those websites. They will work on newer versions of GDM and are supported by `set-gdm-theme` command.

2. When I try to set default GDM theme using `set-gdm-theme` tool, it sets some other theme instead of the default theme. What should I do?

   **Ans:** You should reinstall the package `gnome-shell-common` (if that's not available, then `gome-shell`) and then run the command `set-gdm-theme set --background; set-gdm-theme backup update`. This should fix the issue.

3. Why does that happen?

   **Ans:** That could happen if you use some other program to set GDM theme before using `set-gdm-theme` tool. More information is available in *WARNING* section of `set-gdm-theme(1)` man page. To read it, install `gdm-tools` and then run the command `man 1 set-gdm-theme` on the terminal. When man page shows up, type `/warning` and press enter. This will take you straight to the warning section of man page.
